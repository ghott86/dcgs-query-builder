Any reproduction, dissemination, or use is subject to the OSC usage policy and the original copyright.</p><p>\nEconomic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has claimed that the ANC has planted agent provocateurs to destabilise his new party in the same manner that the governing party destroyed the Congress of the People (Cope) and other black-led parties.\n\n“They are being used as infiltrators to collapse the EFF, render it dysfunctional and impose the same fate as all opposition parties since 1994 that were started and led by black leadership,” he said.\n\nMalema said such tactics would fail in the EFF because he was well aware of them. He claims to have been part of the “underground core” within the ANC that planned and executed the destruction and eventual collapse of Cope from its inception in 2009.\n\nSome disgruntled members of the EFF in Gauteng have accused Malema of dictatorship and of resorting to tactics he used when he was in the ANC Youth League to remove people from crucial positions ahead of the EFF’s elective conference in December.\n\nThese are the first signs of internal strife within the newly formed party that advocates radical interventions such as nationalisation of mines and expropriation of land without compensation.\n\nMalema formed the party after he was expelled from the ANC Youth League. It took more than a million votes during the general elections, giving it 25 seats in Parliament.\n\nMalema branded his accusers moles from within the ANC. He said their words and actions gave them away as plants placed by the ruling party to destroy the EFF.\n\n“We don’t want anyone who brings wrong tendencies in the EFF. We have no room for such people. I was part of the leadership deployed to destroy Cope. I was in that project and I know the tactics and I know and I can see when that tendency emerges. I know how the ruling party operates\n\n“I know what tactics they use. I know the type of resources they use, I know the type of language that gets used by those who are deployed inside. We\n\nknow how to isolate an infiltrator. We know how to isolate a disrupter,” he said.\n\nHe said the EFF had put in place temporary leadership structures to help build the party and prepare it for its first elective conference. As such, no one was guaranteed a position and that all the posts, including his, were up for contestation, but he would not tolerate disruptions.\n\n“We have put temporary structures, people who have been appointed to help us build the organisation. If you are not helping us, the door is open. We want people that will help us. We are going to crush disrupters and infiltrators.”\n\nANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said it was strange that when opposition parties faced internal revolt, they all blamed the ANC.\n\n“The Inkatha Freedom Party is accusing the ANC of being behind its dramatic demise, Agang is doing the same. Why would we be worried about other political parties? We have a government to run,” he said.\n\nKodwa also denied knowledge of any internal ANC structure set up to destroy Cope in 2009.\n\n“We have nothing like that in the ANC,” he said.</p><p>\n[Description of Source: Johannesburg City Press in English -- Privately owned regional weekly newspaper distributed nationally and in neighboring countries including Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and Swaziland.
